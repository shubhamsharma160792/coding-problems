If we analyze the graph, we notice that the points of interest are the consecutive valleys and peaks.


The key point is we need to consider every peak immediately following a valley to maximize the profit. 
In case we skip one of the peaks (trying to obtain more profit), we will end up losing the profit over one of the transactions 
leading to an overall lesser profit.

 Trying to obtain more profit by considering points with more difference in heights, 
 the net profit obtained will always be lesser than the one obtained by including them, 
 since C will always be lesser than A+BA+B.
