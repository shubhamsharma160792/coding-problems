(1) Create a low pointer at the beginning of the array and a high pointer at the end of the array.
(2) Create a mid pointer that starts at the beginning of the array and iterates through each element.
(3) If the element at arr[mid] is a 2, then swap arr[mid] and arr[high] and decrease the high pointer by 1.
(4) If the element at arr[mid] is a 0, then swap arr[mid] and arr[low] and increase the low and mid pointers by 1.
(5) If the element at arr[mid] is a 1, don't swap anything and just increase the mid pointer by 1.
