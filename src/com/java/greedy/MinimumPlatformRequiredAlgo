We can solve the above problem in O(nLogn) time. The idea is to consider all events in sorted order. 
Once we have all events in sorted order, we can trace the number of trains at any time keeping track of trains 
that have arrived, but not departed.



    arr[]  = {9:00,  9:40, 9:50,  11:00, 15:00, 18:00}
    dep[]  = {9:10, 12:00, 11:20, 11:30, 19:00, 20:00}

All events sorted by time.
Total platforms at any time can be obtained by subtracting total departures from total arrivals by that time.
 Time      Event Type     Total Platforms Needed at this Time                               
 9:00       Arrival                  1
 9:10       Departure                0
 9:40       Arrival                  1
 9:50       Arrival                  2
 11:00      Arrival                  3 
 11:20      Departure                2
 11:30      Departure                1
 12:00      Departure                0
 15:00      Arrival                  1
 18:00      Arrival                  2 
 19:00      Departure                1
 20:00      Departure                0

Minimum Platforms needed on railway station = Maximum platforms 
                                              needed at any time 
                                           = 3
