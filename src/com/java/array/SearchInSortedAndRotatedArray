1) Find middle point mid = (l + h)/2
2) If key is present at middle point, return mid.
3) Else If arr[l..mid] is sorted
    a) If key to be searched lies in range from arr[l]
       to arr[mid], recur for arr[l..mid].
    b) Else recur for arr[mid+1..h]
4) Else (arr[mid+1..h] must be sorted)
    a) If key to be searched lies in range from arr[mid+1]
       to arr[h], recur for arr[mid+1..h].
    b) Else recur for arr[l..mid]
